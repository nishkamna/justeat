How long did you spend on the technical test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the technical test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.
I took 30 minutes on the technical test. I would have added other test scenarios like checking incorect pin code and validating the error text, checked login and other links on the website. I would have checked whether it works on play store and app store and other such features.
What do you think is the most interesting trend in test automation?
Integration of the tools to automate the whole process is the most interesting trend in test automation.
How would you implement test automation in a legacy application? Have you ever had to do this?
I would write my test cases in selenium with java and convert those into an xml file using TestNG and run on different browsers using maven dependencies. Finally, I would test those on a Jenkins server.
How would you improve the customer experience of the JUST EAT website?
I would add food bloggers review as well as instagram pictures of the customers. I would also add which restaurant is being ordered and which food has the highest orders.
